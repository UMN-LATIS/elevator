# Elevator

> Multi-instance digital asset repository


Elevator can store content in any format, such as images, audio, video, 3D objects, Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) bundles, and Portable Document Files (PDF) files. Elevator also provides a suite of standard tools for previewing and playing even exotic assets, like 3D walkthroughs and rotatable 3D objects.

## Features

- **Flexible metadata schema.** Create the schemas that are appropriate for your content, mix and match schemas, or make changes at any time.
- **Any digital asset.** Traditional media files, a Microsoft Office document, a SCORM bundle, or a proprietary filetype - Elevator can catalog it, archive it, and in most cases offer rich display.
- **Cloud storage.** Designed to run on the Amazon Web Services.
