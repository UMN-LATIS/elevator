# Other Template Controls

## Sort Order
The sort order for a template controls the order in which fields are shown to curators (those adding assets) and viewers (this viewing assets).  The first item in the “view” sort order will be the title for the asset.  Just drag and drop to rearrange.

## Duplicating Templates
You may wish to create a “Base” template, and then create an advanced version.  To do this, create the base template, then use the “duplicate” feature to clone the template, and add your “advanced” fields.

## Deleting Templates
Deleting templates will cause assets that use this template to be displayed incorrectly.  **Use with caution!**

## Reindex
Some of the changes you make a template may require Elevator to reindex all of the assets that use that template. Normally, that happens automatically via a background process. However, you can force that to happen by clicking the "reindex" link. For large sets of assets, it can still take a few minutes to fully reindex.
