# New Release: 1.7.6

This release introduces a new "gallery" tab within search results and drawer views.  This allows you to navigate assets, including all of their embedded assets.  It can run in fullscreen, or be embedded in other websites.

This release also updates the SVS viewer with the ability to store server-side annotations.
