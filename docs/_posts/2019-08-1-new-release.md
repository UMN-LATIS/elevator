# New Release: 1.8.0

This update has a major change to the backend media processing framework for Elevator. Transcoding services have all been containerized using Docker, and are managed via a separate [GitHub Organization](http://github.com/umn-elevator) and Docker Hub. This provides much more resilience in the face of future updates and OS changes.
