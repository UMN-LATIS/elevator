# New Release: 1.8.4

This release totally revamps the JWPlayer architecture for media playback. This includes support for HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) video delivery. This is optional at the instance-level. HLS delivers much faster video start and seek, and the expense of increased storage usage.

This release also mandates HTTPS for accessing Elevator instances.
