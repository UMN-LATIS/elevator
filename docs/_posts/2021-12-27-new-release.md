# New Release: 2.1.1

Elevator 2.1.1 refines the CSV import process with a new interface and tracking capabilities.

* The CSV import dialog will now show all of your previous CSV imports
* Previous imports can quickly be purged. This is convenient if you have an error during your import. If you were doing an "update" import, the records will be reverted to their previous state.
* The results of an import can be displayed, to quickly find a batch.
