# Database setup, Doctrine commands
* php doctrine.php orm:generate:entities application/models/
* php doctrine.php orm:schema-tool:update


# Docroot
* base directory for dcl3 repo is docroot, .htaccess handles and will need to
be templated
* files in application/config need to be templated appropriately
  - config.php
  - database.php

# Elasticsearch/mongo
* mongo and elasticsearch not currently using auth, doing trust of IP address
  - need to adjust before production, template appropriately
* on first connect app will create schema/collections as needed

# Composer/install
Need to run composer to install required components, will create vendor/ directory 
under install.  Run as DCL user.

# S3 config
* S3 config has been modified, see current bucket in test IAM realm
* Need to automate or document throughly for new installs
  - can this be automated through cloudformation?

# Beanstalkd (queue)
* need to instrument for cloudwatch and apply to autoscale group for transcoders
  - transcoders should stay alive for minimum 45 minutes before dying, since the 
    minimum billing increment is 1h.  Minimize cost, limit number started.

# other notes
* shibposeur is enabled in .htaccess statically, needs to be templated

# open questions
* What shib attributes are required?
* What instance types for each component?
* Mongo replication should be done, how to optimize?  
  - two m3 instances, one m1.small as the third in quorum?
